# About
This is a small Ruby-script to purge emails from sup.
Yes, purging means physically deleting them from your
maildir. This will most likely break your (xapian)
search index.

**status:** active

## Why?
To quote the FAQ:

>Q: How do I delete a message?
>
>A: Why delete? Unless it's spam, you might as well just archive it.
>
>Q: C'mon, really now!
>
>A: Ok, press the 'd' key.
>
>Q: But I want to delete it for real, not just add a 'deleted' flag in
>   the index. I want it gone from disk!
>
>A: Currently, for mbox sources, there is a batch deletion tool that
>   will strip out all messages marked as spam or deleted.

There are people who use maildir. Although harddrives are cheap,
cruft does not have to be tolerated.

## Two versions?
Yes, there are two versions.

### sup-purge
This is the hackish version to be used in scripts.

**Usage:**```sup-purge <dumpfile> <maildir>```


### sup-purge2
This is the point-and-click version based on "sup-purge". Give it the sup-config directory and it will do the rest.

**Usage:**```sup-purge2 <sup-dir>```

## Hints
* To back up your index run: 
```sup-dump > <dumpfile>```
   The dumpfile is plain text and can be compressed easily.
* To restore your index run:
```
rm -rf ~/.sup/xapian;
sup-sync --all-sources --all --restore <dumpfile>
```
* run tests: ```cucumber features/sup-purge.features```
